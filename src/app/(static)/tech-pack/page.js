          It is imperative that one sets things in place before putting out
          investments on a large scale production plan. Apparel Tech Packs set
          standards, processes and guidelines that clothing manufacturers can
          chart and track in order to physically sample the production pieces as
          designed by the clothing designer. Tech Packs augment the essential
          technicalities to fashion design sketches making it production ready.

          <ListItemLi>
            We would first go ahead with styling and submit the flat sketch to
            you (client) for approval and their comments and inputs.
          </ListItemLi>
          <ListItemLi>
            We provide all technical apparel design files through Adobe Reader
            (PDF) files and the spec sheet in an Excel sheet.
          </ListItemLi>
          <ListItemLi>
            Once we receive the comments and inputs, we would proceed with
            modifications and give the final flats for approval. We would also
            require the colorways for the styles.
          </ListItemLi>
          <ListItemLi>
            Once the flat sketches are approved and the colorways for the styles
            are finalized, we would proceed with the technical design of the
            garments.
          </ListItemLi>
          <ListItemLi>
            We would require the logo, trims design, and branding detailing from
            your end (vectors) if you have created them. If not, and you want us
            to do the branding for you, we can provide this service.
          </ListItemLi>
          <ListItemLi>
            Once the flat sketches are approved and we proceed with the tech
            pack detailing, we would not accept any changes in between as we
            would have to change the whole detailing all over again.
